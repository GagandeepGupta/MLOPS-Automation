# MLOPS AUTOMATION


### MLOPS = MACHINE LEARNING on DEVOPS


# Project on integration of Machine Learning  with Jenkins & Docker 

This project is based on the the automation of machine lerning model , when it'll be integrated with docker & jenkins. Bascially to create a machine learning model  is not a tough task as we've to run it  , or trained it & find the accuracy all these things we can find easily with the automation process. we have to only define the job in jenkins according to the our requirements & use cases.and you can make jenkins purely automatic by using the plugin of pipeline's.


# Feature of Project

  1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Python3 and Keras or numpy  installed  using dockerfile 

  2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts train the model in the container.

  3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3, job4 and job5 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 

  4.  Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

  5.  Job2 : We've to the build the our **own docker image** according the our code ( that docker image has been created by me though the **Dockerfile** inside that we've to write the all the libraries required for that code ).

  6.  Job3 : We've to launch the container in docker according to our CNN code.

  7.  Job4 : We,ve to run the CNN code inside our docker & find the **Accuracy** of the model.

  8.  Job5 : We,ve to send the notification to the developer if accuracy of the model is more than 80%.


# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

firstly i write the python code for CNNN model in jupyter notebook & after that i download that code in to **.py extension**  & then copy this code into a seperate folder or directory inside the **RHEL8** operating system with the help of **Winscp software**. After that i upload this code on **GitHub** where i created a repository for the same & initialize this repository in githu


After that i launch my **RHEL8** operating systemtcreate the seperate **workspace** to work on this project & & create A docker file with command 
```
vim Dockerfile  

```
inside this file i used centos: latest version as my base image & install all the required libraries to run the CNN code .

######  CODE For Dockerfile:

```

FROM centos:latest

RUN yum install python36 -y 

RUN pip install --upgrade pip 

From tensorflow/tensorflow:latest

RUN pip install numpy

RUN pip install scikit-learn

RUN pip imnstall matplotlib

RUN pip imnstall pandas

RUN pip imnstall seaborn

RUN pip installl keras

RUN pip imnstall pillow

FROM MNIST-CNN.py

```

After that i start jenkins where i create the chain of job to run the all the processs automatically.

  - Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

  ```
  sudo cp -v -r -f * /root/mlopsws/
  
  ```

  - Job2 : We've to the build the our **own docker image** according the our code ( that docker image has been created by me though the **Dockerfile** inside that we've to write the all the libraries required for that code ).

   if sudo docker ps -a | grep mlops
   then docker rm -f  $(sudo docker ps -aq)
   else
   sudo docker run -dit --name mlops mlops_lib:v1

 -  Job5 : We,ve to send the notification to the developer if accuracy of the model is more than 80%
 
  to send the mail to developer i write a code in python language for sending the mail
  
  
![](MLOps-automation/mail-code.png)
  
 
 ```
 
 #mail.py
import smtplib 

# creates SMTP session 
s = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) 

# start TLS for security 
s.starttls()   

# Authentication 
s.login("sender's mail id", "sender's mail id password")
 
# message to be sent 
message = "Hey Developer, Finally we got the model trained. "

# sending the mail 

s.sendmail("sender's mail id", "reciever's mail id", message)
# terminating the session 

s.quit()
